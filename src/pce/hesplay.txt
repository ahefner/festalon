 Introduction

 The inspiration to write tgemu came from the need to have a player to
 listen to HES music files, which are ripped PC-Engine/Turbografx-16 program
 code much like SID or NSF files. tgemu came into existance, and ended
 up being a full-fledged emulator rather than just a sound playing utility.

 That said, I've removed all of the extra features from tgemu and have
 created hesplay, which exclusively plays HES files and does little else.

 hesplay only supports HES files that are in the PCE format, e.g. files
 that will already work in a PC-Engine emulator. I may add support
 for HES files that consist of the header and data portions only, but
 that has to wait for a future update.

 I'd like to thank Matt Conte for nosefart, from which I used the DOS timer
 routines and borrowed some concepts from dos_main.c

 And everyone else: (alphabetically)

 - Bryan McPhail for the HuC6280 CPU emulation.
 - The MAME team for the SEAL interface code.
 - Mamiya for inventing the HES format.
