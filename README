*Minimum* CPU requirements:

	NSF Playback:
		x86	233-266 MHz Pentium II
		PowerPC	G3/G4 ???

	HES Playback:
		x86	800-1.0GHz Pentium III
		PowerPC G4 800 MHz

On x86 platforms, Festalon will take advantage of the following SIMD 
instruction sets, listed in order of highest preference first:
	SSE3
	MMX
	SSE
	3DNow!

On PowerPC platforms, AltiVec is always used(meaning your processor must support it to use Festalon!).

			*** IMPORTANT ****

It's strongly recommended that you compile with platform-specific code
tuning options(-march or at least -mtune).
	Example: export CFLAGS="-march=i686" ; ./configure

			*** IMPORTANT ****


The "float" type on your processor should be 4 bytes long.

You will need to have "libsamplerate" installed before trying to compile.
