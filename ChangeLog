0.5.5:
	Added "bmp"(Beep Media Player) interface support(./configure --enable-interface=bmp) to the autoconf script.

	Modified the autoconf/automake scripts to generate the xmms library properly, instead of relying on gcc's
	iffy "-share" argument.

	Made a very small optimization to the MMX filtering code.

	Made optimizations to the HES playing code.

0.5.4:  
	Added sanity checks to FESTAI_SetVolume() to make sure -999 < volume < 999.  Negative values are still allowed,
	because we want to allow the truly insane people to invert the phase at will.

	Modified the SexyAL code to better support dynamically-loaded driver modules in the future.

	Added AltiVec-using downsampling code.  Festalon is still awfully slow on G4 processors...

	Fixed a compilation error in filter.h/filter.c that occurred when compiling on non-x86 platforms.

	Fixed x86 CPU detection when using a non-GNU version of expr(particularly, on FreeBSD).

0.5.3:
	Updated "AUTHORS" and "NEWS".

	Console:  Cleaned informational text.

	Console:  Added support for using SDL's audio output.	

	Console:  Fixed sound recording feature.

0.5.2:

	Reworked the sound output device support for the console build.

	Made more HES volume adjustments.  It still doesn't sound correct.

	Added AMD64/x86_64/whatever-sexy-floor MMX filtering code.

0.5.0:	XMMS:  Added a hack to +1/-1 the current song when a change of +5/-5 would have occurred.  This allows the use of
	cursor keys to go up and down the songs, but will obviously break the trackbar when trying to select a song +-5
	away from the current song.

	XMMS:  The current time display and trackbar will now reflect the current song, rather than the current song - 1.

	Added code to play HES(ripped TG16/PC Engine music in an awful format) files, based roughly on "hesplay".  The LFO
	capabilities aren't emulated(yet?).

	Console:  Reduced the number of updates-per-second of the time display, so Festalon will run a bit better on slower
	processors(or over the network).

	Added MMX, SSE-,SSE3-, and 3DNow!-instruction-using FIR filtering code.

	Optimized the square wave channel emulation code with experimental optimizations.
	Ooooh, experimental!

	Added a low-pass filter by using the functions provided by a modified FidLib
	(http://uazu.net/fidlib/).

	Relicensed Festalon under the GNU GPL, from the GNU LGPL.

	Rewrote the resampling code to use simple FIR code, and libsamplerate.

	Made optimizations to the FDS, MMC5, N106, and VRC6 sound emulation code.

	Tweaked the sound emulation code and added a CPU speedup hack.

	Added functions to create NSFs/NSFEs.

	Added a third argument to FESTAI_GetFileInfo() to specify whether or not to load
	the NSF program data.

	Added NSFRawData and NSFRawDataSize variables to the FESTALON structure to aid
	in the (re)creation of NSFs and NSFEs.
	
	Added a "VideoSystem" variable to the FESTALON structure.  The internally-used PAL
	variable is now set in the common initialization code, after the NSF/NSFE loading
	code.
	
	Fixed the structure NSF_HEADER.  It had an 8-byte variable tacked on at the end, from
	debugging(I guess?), that made it longer than it should have been.

	Fixed a bug in the NSFE loader.  A local variable was declared "static" when it should
	not have been.

0.4.0:  Fixed a rather stupid bug that could break loading of certain non-bankswitched NSFs.

	XMMS:  Fixed a "bug" that was breaking the ALSA output plugin.

	Added partial NSFE support.

	Console:  Altered which keys enable and disable channels.  Listed in order of channel:
		1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,!,@,#,$,%,^,&,*,(,)

	Added code to allow NSFs with a specified load address < 0x6000 to play.
	
	XMMS:  Fixed a bug which could cause severe problems on many output
	plugins.

	Console:  Improved the correctness of the time reported(actual calculated
	time into the song rather than how long the song has been playing).

	Console:  Removed DOS support.  Use Linux, crazy DOS people!

	Added support for NSFs with multiple expansion sound chips.  It may not sound
	perfect, due to errors in relative volume levels in Festalon being magnified between 
	the sound chips.

	Massive source code cleanup and movement towards modularization.  0.4.0 will probably
	be a bit slower than 0.3.0.

	Removed the ugly NeoFill() hacks I used to get VRC7 sound working.

0.3.0:	Re-forked off of FCE Ultra 0.98.x.  Sound emulation is greatly improved, but
	there could still be some quirks.  The sound code is rather messy right now, and
	will need to be cleaned(I need hired monkey cleaners).

0.2.4:
	Cleaned up the Makefiles.

	Updated the TODO.

	Replaced the inline assembly in filter.c with better(on my computer)
	C code.

0.2.3:
	Fixed channel disable support for the Namco 106 sound channels.

0.2.2:
	All:  Updated FDS sound code from FCE Ultra 0.93.
	All:  Rewrote pieces of Namco 106 sound emulation code to be more 
	      accurate(including aliasing that is present on the real thing).
	xmms: Added support for pausing the song.

0.2.1:  
	All:  Reimplemented a cpu speed hack.
	All:  Simplified post-downsampling high-pass filter.
	All:  Modified the way the sound channels are mixed, to be more accurate.
	All:  Adjusted volume of VRC6 and VRC7 expansion sound channels.
	All:  Raised default volume to 200%, if that means anything now. :)
	All:  Modified FDS sound emulation.  It's still not right, though.
	All:  Deobfuscated triangle wave linear counter emulation.
	UNIX: Fixed 96KHz playback.
	Winamp: Increased the maximum value of the volume trackbar
		to 250%.

0.1.3:
	All:  Updated README in source code archive.
	Console:  Usage information is now disabled if no filename(s) is(are)
		  provided.
	Console:  Added a time counter.
        Winamp:  Added support for DSP/effects plugins.
        Winamp:  Various minor bugs fixed.
        Winamp:  An installer is now used for the binary release.
        xmms:  Fixed a few major bugs.

0.1.2:
        All:  Default volume changed to 175%.
        All:  Simplified post-downsampling filters.
        All:  Added support for 96KHz playback rate.
        Console:  Version is now printed on startup.
        Winamp:  Updated reported version number.
        Winamp:  Added an internal volume control trackbar.
        Winamp:  The last played song will be played whenever an NSF
                 is stopped and then played again.

0.1.1:
	Removed a CPU emulation speed hack that was messing up sound
	emulation.  It may be readded in the future once I figure out how
	to implement it correctly, as it gave a nice speed boost.
	
	Console interface status line is only updated when necessary, not
	50-60 times a second.

	FME-07, MMC5, and Namco 106 extra sound channels can now be disabled.
	
	Installed sigint and sigterm signal handlers to restore the terminal
	in the console iface for the ctrl-c crazy folk.  Also cleaned up
	multiple file loading code.

	usleep() is used in xmms plugin now.  Other minor changes.  Still
	needs work.


0.1.0:
	First release.
