Fix volume levels of expansion sound chips, and see if their DACs exhibit
any non-linearity.  Also implement a global volume-lowering effect for
all expansion sound chips(they have a resistor across the audio in and audio 
out)...  

Console: Pause audio until the output buffer is full, and then begin playing.  The SDL SexyAL driver does this
	 automatically.

Add support for 64-bit floating point with the JACK output code.  Fix JACK code to support stereo(IMPORTANT!).

Improve volume level calculation in the TG16/PCE emulation code(if it's even broken).

Correct shared library support in the autoconf/automake scripts for xmms/BMP.


SexyAL: Better(dynamic) latency reporting.

	Finish the Sound Blaster code.

	Add OSX CoreAudio code.  This is a lower priority now that the SDL code is working, but it's still important.

	Implement pause and clear functionality with all drivers.
